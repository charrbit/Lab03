                    The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST or "Webb") is a space telescope that is planned to be the successor
                    to the Hubble Space Telescope. The JWST will provide improved infrared resolution and sensitivity over Hubble,
                    and will enable a broad range of investigations across the fields of astronomy and cosmology, including
                    observing some of the most distant events and objects in the universe, such as the formation of the first galaxies.
                    Other goals include understanding the formation of stars and planets, and direct imaging of exoplanets and novas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The primary mirror of the JWST, the Optical Telescope Element, is composed of 18 hexagonal mirror segments made of
                    gold-plated beryllium which combine to create a 6.5-meter (21 ft; 260 in) diameter mirror that is much larger than
                    the Hubble's 2.4-meter (7.9 ft; 94 in) mirror. Unlike the Hubble, which observes in the near ultraviolet, visible,
                    and near infrared (0.1 to 1 μm) spectra, the JWST will observe in a lower frequency range, from long-wavelength visible
                    light through mid-infrared (0.6 to 28.3 μm), which will allow it to observe high redshift objects that are too old and
                    too distant for the Hubble to observe. The telescope must be kept very cold in order to observe in the infrared without
                    interference, so it will be deployed in space near the Earth–Sun L2 Lagrangian point, and a large sunshield made of
                    silicon- and aluminum-coated Kapton will keep its mirror and instruments below 50 K (−220 °C; −370 °F).
